        <h1>Take Note(s)</h1>
        <p>
            This semester I took four technical courses. Interestingly enough, they each had 
            different philosophies when it came to the level of external resources allowed on 
            tests, ranging from the traditional closed note exam to essentially being fully 
            open note. I wanted to share some thoughts on how the varying approaches to test-taking 
            affected both my individual performance and how much I got out of the class overall.
        </p>

        <h3>Closed Note: The Traditional Challenge</h3>
        <p>
            The most "traditional" approach to test-taking came from my R programming class, where 
            no external resources of any kind were allowed on the exams. In this class, both midterms consisted 
            of an assortment of multiple choice and free response questions. Personally, I found this 
            policy a bit unnatural because of how important of a resource documentation 
            is in coding. However, I also get that we should have a baseline understanding 
            of the language that isn't reliant upon documentation. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately for myself, I feel like I came into both midterms a bit too overconfident, 
            underestimating my reliance on documentation to complete the homeworks and lab assignments. Overall though, 
            despite my own performance, I thought the closed book exams were pretty fair: although documentation is an 
            oftentimes vital resource, it's also good to be able to assess where you are at on an individual 
            level, which I think the tests did well.
        </p>

        <h3>A Cheat Sheet: Balance Between Memorization and Strategy</h3>
        <p>
            The next strictest policy came from my algorithms class, where we were allowed to take  
            into exams a two sided sheet of paper filled with any notes of our choosing. In this 
            class, we had two midterms that were slighly different in format. The first midterm had 
            a section devoted to true false that the second midterm did not have. However, for both 
            midterms, the bulk of the questions were about constructing algorithms to solve various 
            problems. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I found the cheat sheet to be helpful, but in a slighly unexpected way. 
            I felt like creating the it was a good way to review what I had learned, but I actually 
            didn't reference the sheet too much during the night of. My paper consisted mostly of definitions 
            and general strategies to approach problems, but those had all already been drilled in from 
            the homework sets and individual studying. As a result, I feel like this format was able to 
            strike an ideal balance between memorization and real time problem solving, rewarding 
            preparation while also providing a safety net to fall back upon.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Open Book: A Double-Edged Sword</h3>
        <p>
            Moving onto the side of more leniency, my numerical methods class provided us the 
            course textbook and Python documentation for all of our exams. Each quiz consisted 
            of a couple conceptual/computational questions followed by two or three coding questions. 
            I feel like the addition of the course textbook being available made it really convinient to just 
            rely upon that rather than my own knowledge. During the quizzes, a lot of the questions could be 
            answered straight up by following formulas from the textbook.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nevertheless, success on quizzes wasn't entirely dependent upon how well you could extract information from 
            the textbook. Some questions just had no real textbook analog and tested whether you truly 
            understood the material on a conceptual level. I enjoyed thinking through those problems, and, admittedly, 
            those were probably the ones I struggled the most with. Overall, I think most questions on quizzes were pretty 
            standard, and, as a result, the textbook acted as a significant crutch. I think it's fine to include the textbook 
            as a resource, but I would have preferred more creative/involved problems where the textbook could be used as reference 
            instead of as a direct source of the answer.
        </p>

        <h3>Open Everything: A Missed Opportunity</h3>
        <p>
            Finally, my statistical modeling class really blasted open the door in terms of allowed resources. On tests, 
            anything besides generative AI tools like ChatGPT were free game for us to utilize. In reality, I referenced a lot of 
            past homework solutions to help guide the solutions I wrote up on the exam. Honestly speaking, this was probably 
            the least "satisfying" course because it just felt like I was copying my old work with very slight modifications. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, I did very well on the tests because this was allowed, but I'm not sure how confident I would be in applying 
            the techniques I learned in a different, more abstract setting. To be honest, 
            A less permissive format might have encouraged more active engagement and better retention. 
            In general, I feel that students adapt to whatever testing philosophies they face, 
            but I’ve found that less "hand-holdy" approaches foster a deeper understanding. While open-resource formats have their place, 
            they’re most effective when paired with more creative, thought-provoking problems.
