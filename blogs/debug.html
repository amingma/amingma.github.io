        <p>
            Whether you’re someone who is just beginning their programming journey or 
            an extremely seasoned developer, the issue of debugging code is definitely an 
            universally frustrating experience. Personally speaking, I have way too many 
            memories of just blankly staring at a computer screen, completely lost as to why 
            my code isn’t running as intended. Fortunately, I also believe these experiences have 
            given me some insight into the debugging process, so I wanted to share a few 
            general suggestions on how we can hopefully debug less and debug happier.
        </p>

        <h3>Don't underestimate a warm up</h3>
        <p>
            I played tennis in high school, and we would spend a good deal of time warming up with
            dynamic exercises and stretches to get our bodies loose and ready for the practice ahead. 
            It might seem strange to bring the same practice into the sedentary environment 
            of programming, but I've actually found it pretty helpful to move around a little 
            and get the heart rate up before starting lengthy assignments. I think an 
            engaged body translates to an engaged mind, which is important because of the 
            focus and thinking coding so often demands. Of course, remember to take breaks 
            in between as well. 
        </p>

        <h3>Preparing to fail is not a failure in preparation</h3>
        <p>
            This probably sounds confusing, but hear me out. No matter how precise or careful 
            we think we are being, the truth is that bugs are an unavoidable aspect of programming. 
            Therefore, we should code in a way that anticipates issues that have not appeared 
            and is considerate towards our future self. By writing clean code that is documented 
            by comments, we can save a lot of time and energy for when those bugs inevitably pop up.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Take accountability</h3>
        <p>
            Personally, I've had an embarrassingly large number of instances where I refused 
            to believe I made a mistake and that there had to be some problem with the 
            computer or some other external issue ... only to realize way too late 
            that I was indeed the origin of the mistake. Although it can be hard to admit fault 
            sometimes, when it comes to your word vs that of the computer, the computer will 
            win 99.99% of the time. So please save yourself the time and just start debugging. 
            If you run into that 0.01%, feel free to send me a very angry email.
        </p>

        <h3>Or take a nap</h3>
        <p>
            Ok, maybe not literally, but it is good to recognize when you are tunneling 
            counterproductively and need to temporarily step away. This is a little hard for 
            me personally because I feel like my natural instinct is to completely stick with a 
            problem until it is solved. However, a lot of times, the problem is solved only 
            because we leave and are able to come back with a new and refreshed perspective 
            on how to approach it. 
        </p>

        <h3>Phone a friend</h3>
        <p>
            Speaking of new perspectives, what better than that of a friend? Even if they aren't 
            totally familar with your project or don't have a programming background in general, 
            it can still be really helpful to verbalize what your issue is to another 
            person. In doing so, you might realize that things that made sense in your head 
            actually don't make so much sense now that you've said them out loud.
